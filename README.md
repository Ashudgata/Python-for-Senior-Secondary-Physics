# Python-for-Senior-Secondary-Physics

The **Python for Senior Secondary Physics** repository is  a collection of python programs I have done for visualizing and working with Physics topics from Senior Secondary School. Separate branches will be done for different topics. This is a work in progress and I aim to further add programs as I go on doing them. The programs will mainly be uploaded as .ipynb files
